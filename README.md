# Occlusion Detection

Given are two aerial images (IMG1, IMG2) of an airport parking bay. 

These images were captured using two cameras placed at different locations and at different instants of time but overlooking the same area. 

It is known that the images are related by an in-plane rotation and translation. 

Determine the changes in IMG2 with respect to IMG1. Use bilinear interpolation during target-to-source mapping.
